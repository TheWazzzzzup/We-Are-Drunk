  hints:
  - So once again darling, I'm craving a drink fit for a queen, something that exudes
    power and elegance, something fashionable. A potion that stands the test of time,
    just like my royal presence. Concoct me something old that slays my taste buds!
  - Now listen again my dear bartender! For I yearn for a libation. Picture the color
    brown, carrying the weight of tradition, aged spirits, and a bit of citrus. Unleash
    that potion and transport me to that era!
  - Ah, my dedicated bartender, a challenge awaits you as I yearn for an iconic libation
    that embodies the essence of bygone sophistication. Picture a drink that stands
    as a timeless testament to refined tastes and unwavering class
  positiveFeedbackLinse:
  - Oh! You have truly unlocked the secrets of my desires, dear subject. This Old
    Fashioned, a divine elixir of sophistication and power, is exactly what I crave.
    Slayed it, darling! Bask in my delight and revel in the glory of my appreciation.
    Your skills have earned my favor, and the realm shall know of your triumph!
  nutrealFeedbackLines:
  - Hmm, it seems you possess a glimmer of potential. You recognized the essence
    of my desires, but alas, the liquid in your chalice missed the mark. Perhaps
    with further dedication, you'll be able to master the alchemical arts and serve
    me a libation befitting my lofty standards
  negetiveFeedbackLines:
  - "Oh, my, my! Did you honestly think that paltry offering would satisfy my royal
    thirst? How utterly disappointing! You flopped\u2026"
  - Oh deer.. A master of mixology would never make such feeble mistakes. I expected
    someone who could slay the cocktail game, not someone who fumbles and fails.
  - "Consider this encounter over, and don't expect a tip from me darling. Goodbye.\u201D"
  greetingLine: I trust your skills will be as sharp as my wit, for only the finest
    concoctions will satisfy my discerning palate.
