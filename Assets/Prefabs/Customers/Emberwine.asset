  hints:
  - Bartender, this day has been bitter, but it has imbued me with wisdom, rich and
    pure, to cherish,  please help me sweeten its end with a fitting drink!
  - The hue of elegance is what I desire, Bartender. The crimson fruit alongside
    the aromatic herb, that would be a perfect combination for me. Maybe something
    a little stronger than the rest.
